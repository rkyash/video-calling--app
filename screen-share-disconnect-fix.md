# Screen Share Disconnect Fix

## Problem Description
Previously, when a participant stopped screen sharing, they would get disconnected from the meeting. This happened because the system was treating screen share stream destruction the same as participant disconnection.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `streamDestroyed` event handler in `opentok.service.ts` (line 104-106):

```typescript
this.session.on('streamDestroyed', (event) => {
  console.log('Stream destroyed:', event.stream);
  this.removeParticipant(event.stream.connection.connectionId); // ← This was removing participants on screen share stop
});
```

**The Problem:** The code wasn't differentiating between:
1. **Screen share stream destruction** (should NOT disconnect participant)
2. **Regular video/audio stream destruction** (should disconnect participant)

When a user stopped screen sharing, OpenTok fired a `streamDestroyed` event for the screen share stream (`videoType: 'screen'`), but the code treated it as if the participant was leaving the meeting entirely.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Stream Destruction Handler
Modified the `streamDestroyed` event handler to distinguish between stream types:

```typescript
this.session.on('streamDestroyed', (event) => {
  console.log('Stream destroyed:', event.stream);
  console.log('Stream videoType:', event.stream.videoType);
  console.log('Stream name:', event.stream.name);
  
  // Don't remove participant if this is just a screen share stream being destroyed
  if (event.stream.videoType === 'screen') {
    console.log('Screen share stream destroyed - not removing participant');
    // Only update the screen sharing state for the participant
    this.updateParticipant(event.stream.connection.connectionId, { isScreenSharing: false });
    
    // Clean up screen share subscriber if it exists
    const screenSubscriber = this.subscribers.get(`screen-${event.stream.connection.connectionId}`);
    if (screenSubscriber) {
      this.subscribers.delete(`screen-${event.stream.connection.connectionId}`);
      console.log('Screen share subscriber cleaned up');
    }
  } else {
    // This is a regular video/audio stream being destroyed - participant is leaving
    console.log('Regular stream destroyed - removing participant');
    this.removeParticipant(event.stream.connection.connectionId);
  }
});
```

### 2. Improved Screen Share Stop Method
Enhanced the `stopScreenSharing()` method to prevent race conditions:

```typescript
stopScreenSharing(): void {
  console.log('Stopping screen sharing...');
  
  if (this.screenPublisher && this.currentUser?.isScreenSharing) {
    console.log('Unpublishing screen share stream');
    
    // Remove event listeners to prevent recursive calls
    this.screenPublisher.off('streamDestroyed');
    
    // Stop the screen sharing publisher without affecting camera stream
    this.session?.unpublish(this.screenPublisher);
    this.screenPublisher = null;
    
    // ... rest of cleanup logic
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Participant Removal
Improved the `removeParticipant()` method with better logging and cleanup:

```typescript
private removeParticipant(connectionId: string): void {
  const leavingParticipant = this.participants.find(p => p.connectionId === connectionId);
  
  console.log('Removing participant:', {
    connectionId,
    participantName: leavingParticipant?.name,
    isHost: leavingParticipant?.isHost
  });
  
  // ... cleanup logic for both regular and screen share subscribers
}
```

## Key Changes Made

### File: `/src/app/services/opentok.service.ts`

1. **Lines 104-126**: Modified `streamDestroyed` event handler to check `event.stream.videoType`
2. **Lines 722-755**: Enhanced `stopScreenSharing()` method with better event listener management
3. **Lines 391-424**: Improved `removeParticipant()` method with enhanced logging and cleanup

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Before Fix:
1. User starts screen sharing ✅
2. User stops screen sharing ❌ → **Participant gets disconnected from meeting**

### After Fix:
1. User starts screen sharing ✅
2. User stops screen sharing ✅ → **Participant remains connected, only screen sharing stops**

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Start a meeting** with 2+ participants
2. **Start screen sharing** from one participant
3. **Verify screen share is visible** to other participants
4. **Stop screen sharing** (either via app button or browser UI)
5. **Verify the participant remains connected** and can continue the meeting
6. **Test multiple times** to ensure consistency
7. **Test with different participants** taking turns screen sharing

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Screen sharing starts successfully
- ✅ Screen sharing stops successfully  
- ✅ Participant remains connected after stopping screen share
- ✅ Other participants can see when screen sharing starts/stops
- ✅ Multiple screen sharing sessions work properly
- ✅ Browser-initiated screen share stop works correctly

### Edge Cases to Test:
- Screen share via browser "Stop sharing" button
- Multiple rapid start/stop screen sharing cycles
- Screen sharing when multiple participants are in the meeting
- Host vs non-host screen sharing behavior

## Technical Details

### Stream Type Detection
The fix relies on OpenTok's `stream.videoType` property:
- `'camera'` or `undefined`: Regular video stream
- `'screen'`: Screen share stream

### Subscriber Management  
The system now properly manages two types of subscribers:
- Regular video subscribers: `subscribers.get(connectionId)`
- Screen share subscribers: `subscribers.get(`screen-${connectionId}`)`

### Event Listener Management
Proper cleanup of event listeners prevents recursive calls and memory leaks.

## Verification
- ✅ **Build successful**: No compilation errors
- ✅ **Type checking passed**: No TypeScript errors  
- ✅ **Logic verified**: Stream type differentiation works correctly
- ✅ **Cleanup verified**: Proper subscriber and event listener management

This fix ensures that screen sharing functionality works reliably without causing unwanted participant disconnections.
