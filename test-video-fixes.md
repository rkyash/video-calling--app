# Video Call Fixes - Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Video Mute/Unmute Visibility Issues

**Problem**: When a user mutes or unmutes their video, the video was not visible to remote users.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added `updateVideoElementVisibility()` helper method to ensure video elements are properly shown/hidden
- Enhanced `streamPropertyChanged` event handler to force video element visibility updates
- Improved `toggleVideo()` method with better state synchronization
- Enhanced signal handling for `muteVideo` events to immediately update video visibility

**Key Changes**:
- `/src/app/services/opentok.service.ts`:
  - Added `updateVideoElementVisibility()` method (lines 414-432)
  - Updated `streamPropertyChanged` handler (lines 100-119)
  - Improved `toggleVideo()` method (lines 514-555)
  - Enhanced `signal:muteVideo` handling (lines 403-407)

### 2. Screen Sharing Visibility Issues

**Problem**: Screen sharing was not consistently visible to participants.

**Fixes Applied**:
- Added proper screen share stream detection and handling
- Created dedicated `handleScreenShareStream()` method for remote screen shares
- Added `forceScreenShareVisibility()` helper to ensure screen share elements are visible
- Enhanced screen share publisher with better event handling and error recovery
- Improved signal handling for screen share events

**Key Changes**:
- `/src/app/services/opentok.service.ts`:
  - Added screen share stream detection in `streamCreated` handler (lines 88-102)
  - Created `handleScreenShareStream()` method (lines 245-280)
  - Added `forceScreenShareVisibility()` helper (lines 781-802)
  - Enhanced `startScreenSharing()` method (lines 553-646)
  - Improved `signal:screenShare` handling (lines 408-419)

## Testing Instructions

### Video Mute/Unmute Testing
1. Start a video meeting with 2+ participants
2. Have one participant toggle their video on/off multiple times
3. Verify that other participants can see the video state changes immediately
4. Check that the video overlay (avatar) appears when video is muted
5. Verify the video stream reappears when unmuted

### Screen Sharing Testing
1. Start a meeting with 2+ participants
2. Have one participant start screen sharing
3. Verify all other participants can see the shared screen immediately
4. Test stopping screen sharing - verify normal video layout returns
5. Test multiple participants attempting screen sharing (should work sequentially)
6. Test browser-initiated screen share stop (via browser UI)

## Technical Details

### Video Visibility Synchronization
- Stream property changes now immediately update DOM element visibility
- State synchronization happens at multiple levels: OpenTok stream, local state, signals, and DOM
- Added failsafe mechanisms with delayed updates to handle race conditions

### Screen Share Reliability
- Screen share streams are now handled separately from regular video streams
- Added proper container waiting mechanisms and fallback creation
- Enhanced error handling and state recovery
- Improved signal timing and visibility forcing

### Performance Considerations
- All DOM updates are debounced with small timeouts (50-200ms)
- Multiple fallback mechanisms prevent blocking
- Proper cleanup and error recovery to prevent memory leaks

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Video Toggle**: Should be instant and visible to all participants
2. **Screen Share**: Should start reliably and be visible to all participants immediately
3. **Error Recovery**: Failed operations should not leave the system in a broken state
4. **State Consistency**: UI state should always match the actual stream state
